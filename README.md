The folder 'starter_code' contains jupyter notebook files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb and respective .ipynb_checkpoinnts along with initial weather_data csv files (2 files, not used for VacationPy, but for testing). The folder 'output_data' contains cities.csv and weather_data_final.csv, used in analysis. The plots are examples given by Triology. Finally, the 'Images' folder contains all respective plots and figures that were generated during the analysis.

Analysis

There is a postive correlation between temperature and latitude, meaning the closer we get to the equator the higher the temperature.

Since data has been collected in the winter, the temperatures are warmer in southern hemisphere.

No representative relationship observed between city, latitude and wind speed, or cloudiness and humidity.

Hotels were mostly found closest to ocean shorelines.
